Testcase0: 4
There are two astronauts from country A and two from country B.
As such, a total of 4 multinational pairs are possible.

Testcase1: 16
There are four astronauts from country A and four from country B.
As such, a total of 16 multinational pairs are possible.

Testcase2: 1
A degenerated case.
There are two astronauts only and each one is from a distinct country.
As such, only one pair is possible.

Testcase3: 34
There are four astronauts from country A, six from country B
and one from country C. In this setting, a total of:
|A| * |B| + |A| * |C| + |B| * |C| == 24 + 4 + 6 == 34 pairs possible.

(the algorithm seems to work correctly, ready to submit.)
